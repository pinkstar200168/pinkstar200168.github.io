# Introverted Interests
From a young age, I have always enjoyed spending most of my time alone. To be honest, most of my interests stem from the fact that I can engage in these activities independently!

### My 3 interests include:
1. Baking
2. Skiing
3. Gelato

## Baking 

I can still remember the time I wanted an American Girl Doll for Christmas. Around the age of eleven, I thought they were amazing and that I’d be really cool if I had one. My mum bluntly said that they were useless and I could have a KitchenAid mixer instead. I wasn’t too happy; at that age, I had no desire to make food. The mixer remained unused for a couple years. I tested out some recipes I found online, and most of the time, the result would be a fail. I either burned the desserts, or undercooked the cakes I would bake. Of course, no one wanted to eat it. 

During high school, I tried again. I stuck to baking brownies and cookies, because it was a lot harder to mess up. My friends enjoyed the desserts I baked, which gave me a lot of satisfaction. I baked to fundraise for different causes, such as this local animal shelter near my school, and a charity dedicated to children who suffered from cerebral palsy and other neurological conditions. As I got older, I got a lot more stressed from school and life. Baking became my coping mechanism to soothe my anxiety. I love that developing my understanding on the techniques of baking. I can make alterations to the recipes when necessary. 

My independence also plays a role in this hobby. I strongly dislike baking with other people and having people in the kitchen at the same time as me, because it stresses me out. Last year, during lockdown, I baked more than ever. I would make at least three desserts a week, and everyone at home would always look forward to the next dessert. In Boston, I certainly don’t bake as often, but when I do, I give it to my brother’s friends and they love it so much! It’s crazy to see how far I have come, and I know that this is a very handy as I can always satisfy my sweet tooth.

## Skiing

Before I begin, I’d like to let you know I am not very athletic. I am very uncoordinated, which makes sports less enjoyable. When I was around five years old, my mum sent me to ski school. My dad tells me I cried every time I went, and that he had to carry me down the slope. I was also very stubborn, and I still am today, which made it difficult and embarrassing for my parents. Five years later, the school I attended had a ski team, and suggested that I compete in the Victorian Interschools Snowsports Championships for fun, and to support the school. I had never competed in a proper race before, so I did not place very well. The next year, my mum enrolled me into race club. That same year, I competed again and ended up coming second in the state! This result shocked everyone, especially me. I think this motivated my mum to force me to do race club each year and go overseas during the summer to train as well. 

Two years later, along with hundreds of hours of hard work, I ended up coming first out of over two hundred competitors; however, I’m pretty sure I came fourth in nationals, which disappointed my mum. I honestly didn’t enjoy skiing. I clearly remember the other kids in my group excluded me because I was weird and not popular. Whenever they went on the lift, they would leave me behind. In retrospect, I’m glad that things went the way they did. If I cared about the social aspect more than the actual skiing, I would have lost focus on my primary goal, which was to make every moment count. While the experience wasn’t as bad as it could have been, I’d definitely say it is something I would not want to relive.

## Gelato


If I could only eat one type of dessert for the rest of my life, I would definitely choose to consume gelato.

Back in Australia, there is a store called Gelato Messina. My obsession started back in 2019. I can’t remember exactly why I went, but I think seeing their weekly specials sparked my curiosity. Every week, starting from Tuesday, they release a new flavor for the next five days, which lasts for a week, unless they sell out before that. Every time I go, I always get three scoops because they give a different waffle cone compared to one or two scoops of gelato. I took photos of my gelato each visit; eventually, I created an album dedicated to Messina!

I have never been so passionate about a certain food until now. They have so many specials; I have probably tried over 100 different flavors from that store. My friends and family think this is an unhealthy addiction, and my mum even tried to limit the amount of times we go each week! Whenever I am in the US, one thing I look forward to when I go back home is visiting Gelato Messina. I even figured out this strategy of finding out the daily special before they post the photos at 5pm. Basically, they open at 12pm, and only deliver through one food delivery app, so what I do is check the app around that time and decide whether I want to go. 

In Boston, I feel like there aren’t many gelato and ice cream shops. The only place I order ice cream from is New City Microcreamery; however, nothing compares to Gelato Messina! It brings me genuine happiness whenever I go, and I don’t feel the need to be around anyone when I savour every lick.
